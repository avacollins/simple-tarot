# Display Card Names

## Overview
- Displays the names of the cards in the Card Node on the graph db.
- Is a test component to ensure the hooks package is connecting to the core api correctly in both storybook and the mobile app.
- Apollo Client and Provider are configured in the `storybook/templates/MobileProviders` component.
- Apollo Client and Provider are mocked in stories using the `MockedProvider` from `@apollo/client/testing` and `Mock Service Worker` to intercept the calls.
- Uses `apollo/client/useQuery` hook and `gql` object to fetch the card names from core-api.
