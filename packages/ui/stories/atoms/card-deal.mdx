# CardDeal Component
The `CardDeal` component is used to display a card in a tarot spread, with the ability to animate its position and rotation based on the spread configuration.

## Overview

The `CardDeal` component is designed to represent a single card within a tarot spread. It utilizes the `react-native-reanimated` library to provide smooth animations for the card's movement and rotation as it is dealt into the spread.

### Props

- `cardIndex`: The index of the card in the spread.
- `spreadIndex`: The index of the spread position.
- `reversed`: A boolean indicating if the card is reversed.
- `dealt`: A boolean indicating if the card has been dealt.
- `onPress`: A callback function to handle card press events.

## State
- `hasBeenDealt`: A boolean state that tracks if the card has been dealt.
- `offset`: An animated value that determines the card's position and rotation in the spread.
