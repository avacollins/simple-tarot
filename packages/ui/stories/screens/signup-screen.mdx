# SignupScreen Component

## Overview
- Wraps the SignupForm component in a full-screen Mobile Keyboard Avoiding View.
- Uses the `useSignupForm` hook to manage form state and client-side validation.

## Props
- `onSubmit`: Function to handle form submission, which sends the email and password to the server.

## State
- `email`: The email address entered by the user.
- `password`: The password entered by the user.
- `confirmPassword`: The confirmation password entered by the user.

## Interaction Tests

    - The hooks package will be updated to integrate specific features and tests will be created.
