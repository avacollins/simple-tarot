# Forgot Password Screen

## Overview
- Wraps the ForgotPasswordForm component in a full-screen Mobile Keyboard Avoiding View.
- Uses the `useForgotPasswordForm` hook to manage form state and client side validation.


## Props
- `onSubmit`: Function to handle form submission, which sends the email to the server for password reset.

## State
- `email`: The email address entered by the user.
- `errors`: Array of error messages related to the email field.

## Interaction Tests 

### Invalid Email Test
- Checks if the form displays an error message when an invalid email address is entered.
- Verifies that the submit button is disabled when there are validation errors. 
- Ensures that the submit button is enabled when email address input updates.


## Future Enhancements

- Generic message to confirm reset request was sent to the server that does not include any information about the email address being valid or found.
